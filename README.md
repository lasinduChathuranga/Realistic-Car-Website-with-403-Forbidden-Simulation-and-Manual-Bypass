# Realistic-Car-Website-with-403-Forbidden-Simulation-and-Manual-Bypass
This project simulates a **real-world web access restriction (403 Forbidden)** on a realistic car advertisement website hosted locally on **Kali Linux Apache Server**. It demonstrates how **access restrictions** can be enforced using `.htaccess` and how attackers may attempt to **bypass** these protections using HTTP header spoofing.
